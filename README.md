# seizure_detection
This repo applies ML techniques to visualise and classify ictal and preictal dynamics. 


'populations' - applies non-negative matrix factorisation to identify key factors in seizure emergence and visualise their spatial extent
'classify' - using NNMF and PCA to visualise low dimensional embedding
