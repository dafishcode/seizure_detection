# seizure_detection
This repo is used for detecting the timecourse of seizure events in generalised and focal seizures in larval zebrafish PTZ data - this repo is very much a work in progress! 

# What is this repo for?
* the implementation of seizure detection algorithms

# What does this repo contain?
* Modules contain functions for running seizure detection 
* Accompanying ipynotebooks demonstrate how to use the modules
* 

## Modules
'admin_functions.py' - useful administrative functions

'detect.py' - functions for detecting seizure events

## Notebooks
'detect.ipynb' - running and implementing detect functions
