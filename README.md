# seizure_detection
This repo applies ML techniques to visualise and classify ictal and preictal dynamics. 


'populations' - applies non-negative matrix factorisation to identify key factors in seizure emergence and visualise their spatial extent

'classify' - seizure classification, uses dimensionality reduction based approaches to identify fast dynamics of seizure - uses SVMs to classify seizure data - work in progress!
